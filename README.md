# CS-320-Software-Automation

Creating the mobile application has provided me with a solid understanding of Software Test Automation. Throughout the development process, I have gained valuable skills in developing fully functional, error-free code. I have had the opportunity to write and test a wide range of functions, which has helped me become confident in my ability to create high-quality software and implement effective testing strategies.

A key takeaway from this course, and from developing this project, is that the process of developing and testing software begins with a deep understanding of the projectâ€™s requirements. Before any development or testing can begin, it is essential to fully comprehend the requirements and plan the development process accordingly, integrating each requirement into the overall design. If a requirement is misunderstood or overlooked early in the design phase, it can negatively impact the entire project, leading to costly delays and issues down the line.

When designing a program or software, whether through pseudocode or another method, it is crucial to focus on creating a secure and efficient architecture, selecting the right data structures, and designing the correct algorithms. The more thorough and careful a developer is in the initial design phase, the smoother and more effective the testing process will be. It is also essential to consider security in the design, though, in this particular project, security wasn't a major concern due to the absence of sensitive data input. Nevertheless, ensuring the design is robust and secure from the start remains a key aspect of software development.
